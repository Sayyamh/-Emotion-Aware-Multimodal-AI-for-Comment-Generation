This project presents an Emotion-Aware Multimodal AI system that generates emotionally aligned comments for images by combining BLIP for captioning, CLIP for vision-language alignment, and Mistral-7B for natural language generation. Users can select an emotion such as joy, sadness, sarcasm, or neutrality, and the system produces comments that not only reflect the image content but also adapt to the chosen emotional tone. Developed at KLE Technological University (Feb 2025 â€“ Jun 2025), this work demonstrates how multimodal AI can enable creative, personalized, and emotionally expressive human-computer interactio
